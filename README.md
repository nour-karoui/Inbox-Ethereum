#### simple smart contract for reading, updating a message


### 🏠 [Homepage](https://github.com/nour-karoui/Inbox-Ethereum)


## Install

```sh
> git clone https://github.com/nour-karoui/Inbox-Ethereum.git
> cd inbox
> npm install
> npm run test
```

## How It Works

In this project, as a start, we prepared a smart contract that can save a message, retrieve it and update it.

***PS***: we can't run this project on the browser, since it's not linked to any client side, to see the execution of the smart contract,
we can either, copy the code contract code from contracts/Inbox.sol in the remix IDE.
Or, simply we can run the tests
